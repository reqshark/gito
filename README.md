gito
=======
### run common git commands slightly faster
[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/reqshark/gito.png?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/reqshark/gito)

Installation
------------

Install with `npm`:

``` bash
$ npm install -g gito
```

Example
-------

Normally a quick push means doing: 

``` bash
$ git add .
$ git commit -m 'your commit message'
$ git push
```

Three steps executed separately at the command line get used to accomplish one thing more often than not.

Gito is a new command line tool so we can just do:

``` bash
$ gito 'your commit message'
```

Changes get added to the index, messaged as a commit, and pushed up with a single quick step.

Be careful with compression commits and pushes, because it's all going to happen fast now in one fell swoop.

## ideas & notes about this software

Gito performs compression commits.

Visible output on the console doesn't display correctly. Would buffering stdout fix this?
